### WARNING! This repo is full of garbage code!

# TODO

- Desktop Enviroment where there are applications you can launch - SEMI-DONE STILL WORK IN PROGRESS!
- Window Collision Function (window pointer and rect to calculate the positions instantly without manually adding)
- RAM Filesystem for testing and fun (basically volatile filesystem) then try to implement an actual filesystem!
- Someway for users to program custom applications (a simple programming language basically) that is runnable
- maybe somehow make it multitask, since currently it definetley going to be single-tasked kernel if the application uses a while loop or infinite for loop

This is a remake of an UEFI Application test I made!
